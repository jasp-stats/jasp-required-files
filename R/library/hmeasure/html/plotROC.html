<h2>
Plotting function illustrating the H-measure of classification performance.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plots ROC curves, weight distributions according to the H-measure and the AUC, and smoothed scoring distributions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
plotROC(results, which = 1, bw = "nrd0", cols = c("red",
                 "blue", "green", "magenta", "yellow", "forestgreen"),
                 greyscale = FALSE, lty = c(1))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>results</code></td>
<td>

<p>An object of class &quot;hmeasure&quot;, which will be the output of the &quot;HMeasure&quot; function applied on the scores of one or more classifiers on the same test dataset, and the true class labels of the test dataset. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>which</code></td>
<td>

<p>The type of plot to be produced. Option 1 yields the ROC curves and their convex hulls; option 2 shows the weights employed by the H-measure; option 3 displays the weights over costs that are implicitly employed by the AUC in this example for each classifier; and option 4 yields the smoothed density plots of the scoring distributions per class.
</p>
</td></tr> 
<tr valign="top"><td><code>bw</code></td>
<td>

<p>The type of bandwidth to be used for the smoothed scoring distribution plot. See help(density) for more detail on possible settings of the &quot;bw&quot; parameter. We employ the same default setting as 'density()', namely &quot;nrd0&quot;. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cols</code></td>
<td>

<p>A list of colours to be used in order for the ROC and convex ROC hulls for each classifier. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>greyscale</code></td>
<td>

<p>A flag which if set to TRUE prints the plot on greyscale, with as much differentiation between classifiers as possible, to support black-and-white journal publications.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lty</code></td>
<td>

<p>The line type.
</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This plotting routine is meant to help users perform graphical comparisons of several classifiers, and to illustrate the difference between the H-measure and the AUC as aggregate measures of classification performance. Four types of plots are available:
</p>
<p>Option 1 plots the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves of each classifier in a continuous colored line, as well as their respective convex hulls in dotted lines. Additionally the ROC curve of the trivial, random classifier is reported, which is a diagonal line. 
</p>
<p>Option 2 plots the prior over misclassification costs employed by the H-measure. The mode of this prior, controlled by the severity ratio parameter, is indicated by a vertical line.
</p>
<p>Option 3 plots, for each classifier, the prior over misclassification costs implicitly employed by the AUC measure, when this latter is interpreted as an averaging operation over different choices of relative misclassification severity.
</p>
<p>Finally, option 4 plots, for each classifier, the (smoothed) empirical probability densities of the score conditional on either class label, i.e., p(s(x) | x = 0), where x is the feature vector and s(x) the score of that feature by a given classifier. Class 0 is plotted using a continuous line, and class 1 using a dotted line. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This plotting function is provided to help illustrate the H-measure, and to serve as a stepping stone in a user's development of further custom plotting functions using the &quot;data&quot; attribute of hmeasure objects.
