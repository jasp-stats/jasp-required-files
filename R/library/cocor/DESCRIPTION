Description: Statistical tests for the comparison between two correlations
    based on either independent or dependent groups. Dependent correlations can
    either be overlapping or nonoverlapping. A web interface is available on the
    website http://comparingcorrelations.org. A plugin for the R GUI and IDE RKWard
    is included. Please install RKWard from https://rkward.kde.org to use this
    feature. The respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a
    repository, as it is a part of RKWard.
