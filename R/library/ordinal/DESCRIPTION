Description: Implementation of cumulative link (mixed) models also known
    as ordered regression models, proportional odds models, proportional
    hazards models for grouped survival times and ordered logit/probit/...
    models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood and mixed models are fitted
    with the Laplace approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
    Multiple random effect terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed or
    partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be
    imposed on the thresholds (cut-points/intercepts). Standard model
    methods are available (summary, anova, drop-methods, step,
    confint, predict etc.) in addition to profile methods and slice
    methods for visualizing the likelihood function and checking
    convergence.
