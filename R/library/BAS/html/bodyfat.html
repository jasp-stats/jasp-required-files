<h2>Bodyfat Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lists estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater
weighing and various body circumference measurements for 252 men.  Accurate
measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have
easy methods of estimating body fat that are not inconvenient/costly.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A variety of popular health books suggest that the readers assess their
health, at least in part, by estimating their percentage of body fat. In
Bailey (1994), for instance, the reader can estimate body fat from tables
using their age and various skin-fold measurements obtained by using a
caliper. Other texts give predictive equations for body fat using body
circumference measurements (e.g. abdominal circumference) and/or skin-fold
measurements. See, for instance, Behnke and Wilmore (1974), pp. 66-67;
Wilmore (1976), p. 247; or Katch and McArdle (1977), pp. 120-132).#
</p>
<p>Percentage of body fat for an individual can be estimated once body density
has been determined. Folks (e.g. Siri (1956)) assume that the body consists
of two components - lean body tissue and fat tissue. Letting
</p>
<p>D = Body Density (gm/cm^3) A = proportion of lean body tissue B = proportion
of fat tissue (A+B=1) a = density of lean body tissue (gm/cm^3) b = density
of fat tissue (gm/cm^3)
</p>
<p>we have D = 1/[(A/a) + (B/b)] and solving for B we find B = (1/D)*[ab/(a-b)]
- [b/(a-b)].
</p>
<p>Using the estimates a=1.10 gm/cm^3 and b=0.90 gm/cm^3 (see Katch and McArdle
(1977), p. 111 or Wilmore (1976), p. 123) we come up with &quot;Siri's equation&quot;:
</p>
<p>Percentage of Body Fat (i.e. 100*B) = 495/D - 450.#
</p>
<p>Volume, and hence body density, can be accurately measured a variety of
ways. The technique of underwater weighing &quot;computes body volume as the
difference between body weight measured in air and weight measured during
water submersion. In other words, body volume is equal to the loss of weight
in water with the appropriate temperature correction for the water's
density&quot; (Katch and McArdle (1977), p. 113). Using this technique,
</p>
<p>Body Density = WA/[(WA-WW)/c.f. - LV]
</p>
<p>where WA = Weight in air (kg) WW = Weight in water (kg) c.f. = Water
correction factor (=1 at 39.2 deg F as one-gram of water occupies exactly
one cm^3 at this temperature, =.997 at 76-78 deg F) LV = Residual Lung
Volume (liters)
</p>
<p>(Katch and McArdle (1977), p. 115). Other methods of determining body volume
are given in Behnke and Wilmore (1974), p. 22 ff.
</p>
<p>Measurement standards are apparently those listed in Behnke and Wilmore
(1974), pp. 45-48 where, for instance, the abdomen circumference is measured
&quot;laterally, at the level of the iliac crests, and anteriorly, at the
umbilicus&quot;.)
