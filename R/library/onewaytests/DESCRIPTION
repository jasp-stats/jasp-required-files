The package performs pairwise comparisons and graphical approaches. Also, the package includes Student's t test, Welch's t test and Mann-Whitney U test for two samples. Moreover, it assesses variance homogeneity and normality of data in each group via tests and plots (Dag et al., 2018, <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-022/RJ-2018-022.pdf>).
