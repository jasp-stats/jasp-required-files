<h2>Bayesian Adaptive Sampling for Bayesian Model Averaging and Variable Selection in
Linear Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sample without replacement from a posterior distribution on models
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
bas.lm(formula, data, subset, weights, na.action = "na.omit",
  n.models = NULL, prior = "ZS-null", alpha = NULL,
  modelprior = beta.binomial(1, 1), initprobs = "Uniform",
  include.always = ~1, method = "BAS", update = NULL,
  bestmodel = NULL, prob.local = 0, prob.rw = 0.5,
  MCMC.iterations = NULL, lambda = NULL, delta = 0.025, thin = 1,
  renormalize = FALSE, force.heredity = TRUE, pivot = FALSE,
  tol = 1e-07, bigmem = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>linear model formula for the full model with all predictors,
Y ~ X.  All code assumes that an intercept will be included in each model
and that the X's will be centered.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame.  Factors will be converted to numerical vectors based on
the using 'model.matrix'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
used in the fitting process.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting
process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. If non-NULL, Bayes estimates
are obtained assuming that Y ~ N(Xb, sigma^2 diag(1/weights)).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>
<p>a function which indicates what should happen when the data
contain NAs. The default is &quot;na.omit&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n.models</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of models to sample either without replacement
(method=&quot;BAS&quot; or &quot;MCMC+BAS&quot;) or with replacement (method=&quot;MCMC&quot;). If NULL,
BAS with method=&quot;BAS&quot; will try to enumerate all 2^p models. If enumeration
is not possible (memory or time) then a value should be supplied which
controls the number of sampled models using 'n.models'.  With method=&quot;MCMC&quot;,
sampling will stop once the min(n.models, MCMC.iterations) occurs so
MCMC.iterations be significantly larger than n.models in order to explore the model space.
On exit for method= &quot;MCMC&quot; this is the number of unique models that have
been sampled with counts stored in the output as &quot;freq&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>prior</code></td>
<td>
<p>prior distribution for regression coefficients.  Choices

<li><p> &quot;AIC&quot;
</p>
</li>
<li><p> &quot;BIC&quot;

</p>
</li>
<li><p> &quot;JZS&quot;  Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow prior which uses the Jeffreys
prior on sigma and the Zellner-Siow Cauchy prior on the coefficients.
The optional parameter 'alpha' can be used to control
the squared scale of the prior, where the default is alpha=1. Setting
'alpha' is equal to rscale^2 in the BayesFactor package of Morey.
This uses QUADMATH for numerical integration of g.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>  &quot;ZS-null&quot;, a Laplace approximation to the 'JZS' prior
for integration of g.  alpha = 1 only. We recommend
using 'JZS' for accuracy and compatibility
with the BayesFactor package, although it is
slower.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> &quot;ZS-full&quot; (to be deprecated)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> &quot;hyper-g&quot;, a mixture of g-priors where the prior on
g/(1+g) is a Beta(1, alpha/2) as in Liang et al (2008).  This
uses the Cephes library for evaluation of the marginal
likelihoods and may be numerically unstable for
large n or R2 close to 1.  Default choice of alpha is 3.
</p>

</li>
<li><p> &quot;EB-local&quot;, use the MLE of g from the marginal likelihood
within each model
</p>
</li>
<li><p> &quot;EB-global&quot; uses an EM algorithm to find a common or
global estimate of g, averaged over all models.  When it is not possible to
enumerate all models, the EM algorithm uses only the
models sampled under EB-local.

Zellner's g-prior, alpha = g, for the Liang et al hyper-g or hyper-g-n
method, recommended choice is alpha are between (2 &lt; alpha &lt; 4), with alpha
= 3 the default.  For the Zellner-Siow prior alpha = 1 by default, but can be used

method are: &quot;Uniform&quot; or &quot;uniform&quot; where each predictor variable is equally
likely to be sampled (equivalent to random sampling without replacement);
&quot;eplogp&quot; uses the <code><a href="eplogprob.html">eplogprob</a></code> function to approximate the Bayes
factor from p-values from the full model to find initial marginal inclusion
probabilities; &quot;marg-eplogp&quot; uses<code><a href="eplogprob.marg.html">eplogprob.marg</a></code> function to

linear regression.  To run a Markov Chain to provide initial estimates of
marginal inclusion probabilities for &quot;BAS&quot;, use method=&quot;MCMC+BAS&quot; below.
While the initprobs are not used in sampling for method=&quot;MCMC&quot;, this
determines the order of the variables in the lookup table and affects memory
allocation in large problems where enumeration is not feasible.  For

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>BAS provides several algorithms to sample from posterior distributions
of models for
use in Bayesian Model Averaging or Bayesian variable selection. For p less than
20-25, BAS can enumerate all models depending on memory availability.  As BAS saves all
models, MLEs, standard errors, log marginal likelihoods, prior and posterior and  probabilities
memory requirements grow linearly with M*p where M is the number of models
and p is the number of predictors.  For example, enumeration with p=21 with 2,097,152 takes just under
2 Gigabytes on a 64 bit machine to store all summaries that would be needed for model averaging.
(A future version will likely include an option to not store all summaries if
users do not plan on using  model averaging or model selection on Best Predictive models.)
For larger p, BAS samples without replacement using random or deterministic
sampling. The Bayesian Adaptive Sampling algorithm of Clyde, Ghosh, Littman
(2010) samples models without replacement using the initial sampling
probabilities, and will optionally update the sampling probabilities every
&quot;update&quot; models using the estimated marginal inclusion probabilities. BAS
uses different methods to obtain the <code>initprobs</code>, which may impact the
results in high-dimensional problems. The deterministic sampler provides a
list of the top models in order of an approximation of independence using
the provided <code>initprobs</code>.  This may be effective after running the
other algorithms to identify high probability models and works well if the
correlations of variables are small to modest.
We recommend &quot;MCMC&quot; for
problems where enumeration is not feasible (memory or time constrained)
or even modest p if the number of
models sampled is not close to the number of possible models and/or there are significant
correlations among the predictors as the bias in estimates of inclusion
probabilities from &quot;BAS&quot; or &quot;MSMS+BAS&quot; may be large relative to the reduced
variability from using the normalized model probabilities as shown in Clyde and Ghosh, 2012.
Diagnostic plots with MCMC can be used to assess convergence.
For large problems we recommend thinning with MCMC to reduce memory requirements.
The priors on coefficients
include Zellner's g-prior, the Hyper-g prior (Liang et al 2008, the
Zellner-Siow Cauchy prior, Empirical Bayes (local and global) g-priors.  AIC
and BIC are also included, while a range of priors on the model space are available.
