Description: Functions to convert a page of plots drawn with the 
  'graphics' package into identical output drawn with the 'grid' package.
  The result looks like the original 'graphics'-based plot, but consists
  of 'grid' grobs and viewports that can then be manipulated with 
  'grid' functions (e.g., edit grobs and revisit viewports).
